--MODAL/FETCH RENDERING NOTES:
       -At the moment, the way the actual custom hook is getting called (fetch),
        is from the [pageNum, setTriggerRender] dependency array.
        -This is a problem, because now the header is not causing re-fethces

--NOTE:
      -Pagination (endless scroll) is disabled for raids until JOINs issue is solved.
      -We added a useRef to store the maxRaidId seen for a proposed solution
      -The backend adds this max raid at upon returning the results

-The reason the 'ref' passing is different for 'Characters', 'Raids', 'Loot' query cards:
       -So, the refs for these are for pagination / endless scroll. We mark the 10 element with a ref,
        and when we intersect with this element, we perform another fetch and append the new fetch onto
        our results array.

       -So why do we pass the refs differently for all three? Well, The 'Characters' and 'Loot' views display
        the QueryCards in containers of pairs. This means that we mark the 10th pair container with the ref.
        This is UNLIKE the raids view, in-which we display one card a time, thereby marking the 10th card.

       -TLDR: React.forwardRef is called in: 'Characters.jsx', 'Loot.jsx', and 'RaidsResultCard.jsx'
